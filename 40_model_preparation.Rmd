# Prepare data for modeling 

The dataset is now ready for modeling. 

```{r}
head(games)
```

There are many options for which variables one would include in a model. A few examples: 

1. The effect of shot quality (high-, mid-, or low-danger) in predicting goals for and against each team. 
2. Is PDO (shooting percentage + save percentage and a common measure of "luck") indeed the most important factor in winning a game? Â®

3. The effect (if any) of things like attendance and time of year on on-ice performance.
